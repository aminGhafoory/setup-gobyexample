# setup-gobyexample
[gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com) is a really good starting point in learning golang but it's hard and teadios to make dozens of folders for each lesson this is a script just for that.

this script creates a directory for each lesson with a `main.go` file ; main.go file is valid go code and can print the lesson name

## HOW TO USE

- you need a linux machine or you can use WSL if you are using windows
- place this script in your desired directory
- add executable permission to script using chmod  `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
- run the script `./setup.sh`

have fun ðŸŽˆ
